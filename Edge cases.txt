Edge Cases

1. Minus operator at beginning 
	if we have a '-' operator at beginning we consider the operand followed by it as negative number

2. Plus operator at beginning
	if we have a '+' operator at beginning, we ignore it and remove it from the expression.

3. Two simultaneous operators
	we check the presence of operator at any undesired position ( even indices viz, 0, 2, 4 ...). If found, return "Invalid expression!"
	Presence of operator other than '+' and '-' at beginning is also handled by this test case.

4. More than one decimal point in single operand
	Prints "Invalid Number!" on calculator screen.

5. Operator at end
	Returns "Invalid Expression!"

6. Directly clicking '=' button without entering operands
	Reurns "Expression Not Entered!"
